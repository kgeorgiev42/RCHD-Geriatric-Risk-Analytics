# COVID-19 Process Mining Analysis

This document provides an overview of the notebooks in the `process_mining` folder, which support process mining and conformance checking for COVID-19 hospital care pathways, relevant to Chapter 6 of the thesis. These notebooks show functionality for the analysis and visualisation of event logs, Petri net models, subgroup analyses, and performance metrics.
