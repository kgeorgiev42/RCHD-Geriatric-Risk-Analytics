# Future pipeline

This section will be used to design scripts around reproducible ML and PM pipelines for geriatric care pathway analytics, relevant to the thesis chapters. The main objective will be to allow a reasonably good reproduction of the conducted experiments within Chapters 6-8 on synthetic (dummy) data outside of NHS Lothian care systems.
